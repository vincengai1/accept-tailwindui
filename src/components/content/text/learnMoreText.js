            How to find results from future research?
        </div>

          <p class="text-sm ">
            We may have to collect study coded data and biosamples from many people over many
            years before we can know if the results of future research are meaningful. <br/> <br/>

            Therefore, you should not expect to receive individual results from future research projects.
            We will not give any such data to your doctor and we will not put them in your medical
            record as they are not individual valid results. <br/> <br/>
            <b>
            You are free to consent to the use of your coded data and biosamples for FUTURE
            RESEARCH. If you agree, you can indicate this in the CONSENT FORM.</b>

What is the purpose of this consent?
You are invited to take part in this study because you have human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2-positive) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). HER2-positive MBC means that your tumour has tested positive for a protein called HER2 that promotes the growth of cancer cells and has caused the cancer to spread from your breast to the other parts of your body.

Participation requires your written consent. This Informed Consent Form gives an explanation about what the study involves, including:

1) The purpose of this study and what you will be asked to do as part of this study;

2) The information that may be collected from you as part of this study and how your information will be used or disclosed in the study;

3) The potential risks and discomforts associated with this study; and

4) How you may withdraw from the study and what happens to your information after you withdraw.

Your decision to participate is voluntary
You have a choice whether or not you would like to participate. Your cancer may or may not improve if you join the study, however the information we get from this study might help other patients with the same kind of cancer in the future.

Please take as much time as you need to make a decision about whether or not you would like to participate in this study. It may be helpful to talk with your friends and family as you make this decision.

If you join the study, you can leave at any time (see “Section 14” for more details). Leaving will not affect your care. If you choose to leave the study, please let your study doctor know as soon as possible. Please consider the study time commitments and responsibilities as a research patient when you are deciding to take part. If you do not join the study, you will continue to receive care for your HER2-positive MBC. Your study doctor or treating physician will talk to you about other possible treatments and their risks and benefits.
