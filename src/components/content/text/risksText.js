          There is a risk that your MBC will not get better, or even get worse during the study. It is
          possible that some patients could have side effects that we do not know about yet. If you
          have severe side effects from any of the study treatments, the study doctor may ask you
          not to continue in the study. <br /><br />
          Some normal cells also have small amounts of HER2 on their surface that could bind to
          trastuzumab deruxtecan. This binding to normal cells could lead to side effects. The
          chemotherapy molecule DXd can also damage neighbouring cells after killing a cancer
          cell. This could also cause side effects.<br /><br />

            <ul>
              <li><b>Heart problems:</b>
                The heart is a pump to circulate blood to the whole body. If the heart does not pump the way it should you may experience shortness of breath, noticeably rapid, strong or irregular heartbeat or abnormally rapid heart rate.

Symptoms of allergic reactions can include rash, joint pain, face, lip or tongue     swelling, wheezing and difficulty breathing, and/or sudden drop in blood pressure. A severe allergic reaction could be life threatening. Your physician is trained to treat these emergencies.

                The symptoms which occur during injection of drug or after the injection of drug     (within the day in many cases) are called ‘infusion reactions’. The symptoms may include, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, cough, dizziness, rash, and/or lower back pain usually of mild to moderate severity and may lead to shortness of breath and severe lowering of blood pressure.

          There could be potential for overlapping side effects when T-DXd is used in combination
          with the other cancer treatments in this study. This means it is possible that the combination
          of drugs in each module may cause some side effects that are more severe or take longer
          to resolve than when the medications are given on their own. It is also possible that
          unexpected toxicities (side effects) may occur that do not happen when either medication
          is given on its own. You will be closely monitored for any side effects. <br /><br />

          The study drug durvalumab works by increasing the immune system’s ability to recognize
          the cancer. This may cause side effects, which can occur when the drug is given or after
          the drug is given (within hours, days or weeks after).

        <p className="pageText" style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
          <span style="font-weight: 800;"> Most of the possible side effects listed above are mild to moderate.</span> However, some side
          effects can be very serious and life-threatening and may even result in death. Some side
          effects do not need treatment while others generally get better with treatment. You may
          need to delay doses of durvalumab to allow the side effects to get better. Management of
          these side effects may also require the administration of drugs such as steroids or other
          agents that can affect your immune system and reduce inflammation.

        <p className="pageText" style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
          In addition to the possible risks identified in patients treated with durvalumab, other

          Like many other anti-cancer medicines, paclitaxel may cause sterility, which could be
          permanent. Paclitaxel may cause inflammation of the lungs when used in combination with,

          Because the effects of the study treatments on an unborn child or infant are not known, you
          (or your female partner if you are a man) must not get pregnant or breastfeed a child during

          are a woman) and 4 months (if you are a man) after the last dose of study treatment
          administration. You must not donate, or retrieve for your own use, ova from the time of
          screening and throughout the study treatment period, and for at least 7 months after the
          final study treatment administration. The study doctor can discuss acceptable birth control
          methods with you.
          If you or your partner become(s) pregnant, you must tell the study doctor immediately. You
          will have to stop taking the study treatment immediately and you and your partner will be

What are the potential side effects and risks?
Most of the potential side effects are common with cancer treatment.

1 serious side effect has been reported with T-DXd: lung problems (pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD). These lung problems may be life-threatening or fatal. Symptoms may be similar to other lung or heart diseases. Your doctor will check for these signs and symptoms while you receive treatment with T-DXd and may treat you with corticosteroid medications. If you develop serious lung problems during the study, they may also delay or stop your treatment.
What are the risks of joining the study?
There is a risk that your MBC will not get better, or even get worse during the study. It is possible that some patients could have side effects that we do not know about yet. If you have severe side effects from any of the study treatments, the study doctor may ask you not to continue in the study.

Some normal cells also have small amounts of HER2 on their surface that could bind to trastuzumab deruxtecan. This binding to normal cells could lead to side effects. The chemotherapy molecule DXd can also damage neighbouring cells after killing a cancer cell. This could also cause side effects.

The possible discomforts, side effects, and risks related to trastuzumab deruxtecan treatment are not all known. Based on all the health data collected, the following adverse events (AEs) have been reported and identified as risks associated with the use of trastuzumab deruxtecan.

Possible risks associated with trastuzumab deruxtecan, T-DXd
May affect more than 1 in 10 people.
nausea
feeling tired(fatigue)
vomitting
hair loss
constipation
feeling less hungry
decrease in the number of red blood cells (anemia)
decrease in the number of neutrophils (neutropenia)
diarrhea
decrease in the number of platelets (thrombocytopenia)
coughing
decrease in the number of white blood cells (leukopenia)
stomach (abdominal) pain
infections of the upper respiratory tract

dry eye
indigestion (dyspepsia)
dizziness
sores in or around your mouth (stomatitis)
abnormal liver enzyme results (increase in aspartate aminotransferase)

low potassium in the blood (hypokalemia)
rash
general body weakness (malaise)
decrease in the number of lymphocytes (lymphopenia)
fever (pyrexia)
swelling of lower legs or hands (edema peripheral)
