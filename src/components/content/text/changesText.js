  Changes may happen in the study that could make you change your mind about continuing
  to take part. If something changes, we will tell you as soon as possible. You can choose to
  leave the study at any time. For more details see the Withdrawals section. The study doctor can
  also choose to take you out of the study if they believe that it is best for you. Your participation
  in the study also stops when the sponsor, health authorities, the ethics or regulatory agencies
  decide that the study must be stopped.

  If there is an emergency, call your 24-hour contact right away or go to the closest emergency
  room and contact your study doctor as soon as you can.
  If you become ill or are injured while you are in this research study, you must tell your study
  doctor straight away. Injuries that have been caused by the study treatments, tests or
  procedures are called ‘research injuries’. Injuries caused by your usual medical care or
  your breast cancer, are not research injuries.
  The sponsor has an insurance to cover the costs of research injuries as long as you have
  followed your study doctor´s instructions. The sponsor will pay the costs of medical
  treatment for research injuries, provided that the costs are reasonable, and you did not
  cause the injury yourself. If you have medical insurance, please check with your insurance
  company that taking part in this research study will not affect your coverage.
  The sponsor may also compensate you in accordance with the law of <b> INSERT COUNTRY </b> and by
  signing this form you do not give up any legal right you may have.

What happens if something changes during the trial?

What are the possible benefits of taking part?
The main potential benefit is improving outcomes for future patients.
Initial research suggests trastuzumab deruxtecan, or T-DXd, could help slow the progress of HER2-positive MBC.

There is no certainty that you will have any benefit from any of the study treatments. However, it is possible that the study treatment could delay your MBC from getting worse. The information the study sponsor receives from this study may help to improve treatments for patients with HER2-positive MBC. It is not certain that you will directly benefit from the participation in the study. Your participation may, however, help other patients in the future by improving the knowledge of diseases and improving medical care.
