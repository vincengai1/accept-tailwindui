What will happen if I want to quit the study?
You can stop your participation at any time.

There are 2 options:

- Study discontinuation: You stop treatment and data collection, and your previously collected data and biosamples will be kept and used.

- Withdrawal: You stop treatment and data collection, and your previously collected data and biosamples will not be kept and used.
Your participation in the study is voluntary which means you can stop your participation at any time. If you want to stop taking the study treatment, want to have a modified visit schedule or if you want to stop your participation, you should tell the study doctor.

If you stop participating in the study (be aware that this is a “study discontinuation”, and not a withdrawal of/ objection to consent for processing personal data), the study doctor will stop the collection of your data but your previously collected data and biosamples will be kept and used to guarantee the validity of the study and comply with regulatory requirements, as allowed by law.

What if I want to withdraw from future research?
Your participation in future research is voluntary. You are entitled to withdraw your consent for future research at any time, without giving a reason and without a negative effect on your standard of medical care. If you wish to withdraw, please inform your study doctor.

You may still continue to participate in the clinical study even if you choose to withdraw from future research.

If you withdraw from future research, your coded data and biosamples will not be used for future research and your samples will be destroyed as soon as possible
